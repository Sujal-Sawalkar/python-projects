# ðŸ¤– SujalBot - A Simple Rule-Based Chatbot

SujalBot is a beginner-friendly Python chatbot that uses predefined responses based on user input.  
It runs in the terminal and responds to greetings, questions, and exits when the user types `"bye"`.

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

- Uses a Python dictionary to store inputâ€“response pairs
